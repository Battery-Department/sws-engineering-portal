# Claude Code Instructions - South West Steam Engineering Portal

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: MANDATORY FILE READING BEFORE ANY WORK ‚ö†Ô∏è

**STOP! You MUST read these files first using the Read tool:**

1. **üî¥ REQUIRED**: `/Users/oliver/South_West_Steam_Engineering/engineering-dashboard/SWSE_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
   - This contains ALL project context, architecture, and implementation details
   - Read the ENTIRE file before making any changes
   - Contains navigation structure, API details, database schema, and more

2. **üî¥ REQUIRED FOR UI**: `/Users/oliver/South_West_Steam_Engineering/engineering-dashboard/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
   - Read this for ANY user interface changes
   - Contains exact color values, component standards, and styling rules

**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT READING THESE FILES FIRST**

## Project Overview
This is the South West Steam Engineering portal - an enterprise engineering project management platform specializing in steam locomotive restoration, CAD design, and bespoke fabrication services. The platform uses a consistent, professional design language throughout.

## Key Design Elements to Always Follow

### Primary Colors
- Primary Blue: `#006FEE` (Professional engineering blue)
- Dark Blue: `#0050B3`
- Blue Gradient: `linear-gradient(to right, #006FEE, #0050B3)`

### Component Patterns
1. **Cards**: White background, 12px radius, 2px solid #E6F4FF border, 24px padding
2. **Buttons**: Primary (#006FEE), Secondary (white with border), always with hover effects
3. **Inputs**: 2px borders, #F9FAFB background, focus glow effect
4. **Headers**: Blue gradient for main headers, white for section headers

### Must-Have Effects
- Hover lift: `translateY(-4px)` with shadow
- Focus glow: `0 0 0 3px rgba(0, 111, 238, 0.1)`
- Transitions: `all 0.3s ease` for smooth animations
- Blue shadows for primary elements
