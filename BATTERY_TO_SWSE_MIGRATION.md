# Battery to SWSE Branding Migration Plan

## Migration Strategy
As a senior engineer, I'm taking a systematic approach to rebrand all battery references to SWSE engineering terminology.

## Priority Order:
1. **Customer-Facing Components** (High Priority)
   - Homepage and landing pages
   - Product pages and calculators
   - Authentication pages
   - Customer dashboard

2. **API Routes and Services** (Medium Priority)
   - Authentication endpoints
   - Chat services
   - Quiz functionality

3. **Internal Components** (Lower Priority)
   - Admin dashboard
   - Settings pages
   - Test files

## Replacement Mapping:
- "Battery Department" → "South West Steam Engineering"
- "battery.com" → "swse.co.uk"
- "batterydept.com" → "swsteam.co.uk"
- "Lithi" → "SWSE"
- "lithium" → "steam engineering"
- "battery" → "engineering solution" (context dependent)
- Battery calculators → Engineering project calculators

## Progress Tracking:
- [ ] Customer homepage components
- [ ] Product components
- [ ] Authentication pages
- [ ] API routes
- [ ] Services
- [ ] Portal pages
